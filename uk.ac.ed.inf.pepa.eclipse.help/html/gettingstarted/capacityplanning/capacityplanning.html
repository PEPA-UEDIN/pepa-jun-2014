		<h3>This guide</h3>
		<p>
			This guide provides a step by step description of the <b>Capacity Planning Tool</b> (CPT).
		</p>
		<p>
			It shows how to configure the tool in order to search for some <b> optimal model configuration</b> of system components. This page gives an
			overview of the tool in order to provide insight into how the tool works, and therefore how to configure the tool for a search. We start with
			a breif motivation, and then provide a high level view of the CPT.
		</p>
		<p>
			Familiarity with PEPA is assumed. To learn more about PEPA
			visit <a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pepa/">the PEPA web site</a>.

		<h3>The Capacity Planning Tool</h3>
		<center><h4>Motivation</h4></center>
		<p>
			Real systems are expected to service some <b>demand</b> with good <b>performance</b>. For example; a cloud based web-service
			may have a Service Level Agreement (SLA). This SLA might stipulate that the web-service will have a number of clients
			when operating (service demand) and must respond to all client requests within a certain time (performance).
		</p>
		<p>
			Real systems are usually complex systems, and are <b>compositions of resources</b>. A naive approach to satisfying the SLA would be to 
			continue adding resources to the system until the system starts performing as required. We want to avoid <b>over-provisioning</b>,
			where we have under-used resources, these are adding to our operational cost unnecessarily. We want to avoid <b>under-provisioning</b>,
			as this means our system is not going to meet the SLA.
		</p>
		<p>
			We want an <b>optimum configuration</b> of resources, a configuration that uses the fewest number of resources, but still provides
			the expected service demand with a good performance. Searching for optimal configurations is time consuming and difficult, the CPT
			is an automated tool designed to aid the modeller in finding an optimal confguration, and in gaining some insight into the systems' behaviour 
			when we consider the number of resources as a parameter.

		<ol>
		<li> The designer creates a PEPA model in the <a href="../editor.html">PEPA editor</a>.
		<li> Then the designer starts the CPT choosing either a <a href="drivenPSOSearch.html">Driven Particle Swarm Optimisation (dPSO)</a> or
			<a href="singlePSOSearch.html">Single Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)</a> search.
		<li> The search engine creates ODE graphs in order to evaluate each model.
		<li> The ODE evaluation passes back the measured performance.
		<li> The CPT passes a tree view of the results, with the model configuration with the least cost at the top.
		<li> The CPT also passes a list view of the results, sorted in ascending cost.
		</ol>
		
		<center><h4>Performance evaluation</h4></center>
		
		The CPT can evaluate models on:
		
		<ol>
		<li> Capacity Utilisation
		<li> Population levels
		<li> Throughput
		<li> Average Response-Time
		</ol>
		
				<center><h4>Search algorithm</h4></center>
		
		The CPT uses Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) to search through a model configuration search space. In a dPSO the CPT uses a Hill Climbing algorithm in
		order to find the best PSO settings for a model configuration search.
