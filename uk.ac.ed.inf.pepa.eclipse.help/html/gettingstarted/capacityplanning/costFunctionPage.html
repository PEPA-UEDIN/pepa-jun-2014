		<p>
		The above is a screen shot of the second page of the CPT wizard. In this page you are configuring the Cost function parameters:
		</p>
		
		<ol>
		<li> Performance weight* - increasing this with respect to the population weight makes performance cost 
		a "more important" cost to reduce than population cost.
		<li> Population weight* - converse to the above, an increase in population weight makes population cost 
		"more important" to reduce than performance cost.
		</ol>
